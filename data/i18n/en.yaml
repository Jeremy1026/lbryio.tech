# This file contains the text of the LBRY website, organized with labels.
# Text segments are organized hierarchically. For any given language, the user's
# browser will look at the corresponding language file for the appropriate label
# and render the segment in the correct language.
# For example, global.tagline renders as "Play, Share, Earn" if the user's langu
# age settings are set to English, and the same label renders as "Assista, Compa
# rtilhe, Ganhe" if the user's settings are set to Portuguese.
