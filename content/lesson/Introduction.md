## **LBRY** is an open-source "fat" protocol, providing decentralized content discovery and distribution.

### In just a few minutes, you will have:

* Learned the basics of the LBRY API.
* Irrevocably inscribed a piece of knowledge. Possibly of a cat.

### How this works:

* In this area you'll be given a task, or short sequence of tasks to complete.
  * For example, you might be asked to enter a command to show all available commands.
* In the area to the right there is a command prompt ready to go.
  * You can enter any valid API command in it and it will process and display the results.

### Try it out:

Go ahead and take the command prompt for a spin. When you're ready to move on, click the button below to go to your first task.
